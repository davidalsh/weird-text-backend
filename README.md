# WeirdText

WeirdText is a text encoding.
It is not “encryption” because humans can usually read it quite easily. But machines may
find it difficult to read without the list of original words. Except of having fun, there are
real-world applications for this, e.g. if encryption is forbidden by law in your country, but
you still don’t want your email content to get automatically processed somehow.
